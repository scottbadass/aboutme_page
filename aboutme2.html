    <h3> Where I'm From</h3>
    <p>Raised in New York City but I now live in San Francisco, CA. I didn't know I love the outdoors until I moved here, there are so much to do and so far I hiked few historical mountains, camped at the beach of Half Moon Bay. The exciting things is that everything is close distance; Oh by the way the wine country, there is nothing compare to Napa Valley.Prager was my favorite!
